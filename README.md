Needs handlandamarks task from googlemediapipe
You can train the model and also use pointer mode
It does check windows start menu shortcuts for available actions and that might cause issues
Thanks in advance!


PS - I intended to push the new changes to show up in the codereview and not in this repo, however apparently I have severe skill issue in github and pushed it to main, I havent changed much however
-Window remains fixed 
-And removed comments (Stupidity) 
-And some pointer mode fixes 

The initial project was still implemented and pushed before due date
Once again sorry for severe skill issue🥲
